<h2>Health and healthy lifestyle</h2>
<img src="health.jpg" alt="health">
<div>
  <p>A <b>healthy lifestyle</b> is a set of habits and actions that help strengthen and maintain immunity and physical capabilities, and eliminate factors that negatively affect well-being and the body as a whole. A strict concept of a healthy lifestyle has not been formulated, so people often perceive it in their own way. For some, this is sports seven times a week, while others believe that they have begun to lead a healthy lifestyle by giving up alcohol and cigarettes.<br>The concept became widespread in the 1970s, when people realized that progress inevitably leads to a decrease in physical activity, nutritional costs and bad habits. Doctors began to note genetic predispositions to health problems and the ability to avoid complications by following certain daily rules.</p>

  <p>Taking a walk right after work. No matter how bad or long of a day I just had, it gets me home feeling much more relieved and better about myself and it makes me sleep much better. I live in a big busy city but we have temperate climate and fresh air most of the year and my walking route takes me through some quiet neighborhoods and nice small parks. Sometimes I stop by for a snack or a coffee from one of the stands/kiosks. Sometimes I have music in my ears, and sometimes I just listen to the sounds around me. Some days, I take different routes that could also be longer just to discover new areas. <br>It's always a pleasant experience and much better and healthier than going directly home with an uber (also much cheaper, its free!) or public transportation, experiencing horrid traffic and then just doing what I was doing at work for the past 8-10 hours which is sitting on my ass staring at a screen until I get sleepy enough to fall asleep.</p>
